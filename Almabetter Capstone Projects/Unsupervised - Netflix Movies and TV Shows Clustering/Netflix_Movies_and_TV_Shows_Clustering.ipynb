We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle the curse of dimensionality. 4000 components were able to capture more than 80% of variance, and hence, the number of components were restricted to 4000. We first built clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm, and the optimal number of clusters came out to be 6. This was obtained through the elbow method and Silhouette score analysis.\n",
